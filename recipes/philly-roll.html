    <h2>A simple but tasty sushi roll that will annoy the purists.</h2>
    <p>Just a few ingredients, but flavor that is far greater than the sum of its parts, and a great recipe for sushi beginners!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>4 half sheets sushi grade nori</li>
        <li>4 oz smoked salmon</li>
        <li>4 oz cream cheese, cut into matchsticks</li>
        <li>1 small cucumber, cut into matchsticks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the sushi rice with the rice vinegar, fanning and stirring until room temperature.</li>
        <li>On the rolling mat place one sheet of nori with the rough side facing upwards.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands and grab a handful of rice and place it on the nori. Spread the rice evenly throughout the nori without smushing the rice down.</li>
        <li>Arrange, in a horizontal row 1 inch (2 cm) from the bottom, smoked salmon, cream cheese, and cucumber.</li>
        <li>Grabbing both nori and the mat, roll the mat over the filling so the extra space at the bottom touches the other side, squeezing down to make a nice tight roll. Squeeze down along the way to keep the roll from holding its shape.</li>
        <li>Transfer the roll onto a cutting board. Rub a knife on a damp paper towel before slicing the roll into six equal portions.</li>
    </ol>
